1. Compiling and executing the project

    This project is implemented in Java 1.8. A Makefile is included to compile 
    the project in the root directory. To execute the project code, simply issue
    "./COMMAND" at a command line prompt.

2. Testing the project

    The project may be batch tested using the framework initially provided——

    Run "python tester.py". All .test testcases located in tests/ will be run 
    sequentially and generate .ans files in the answers/ directory. These will 
    be compared against the expected output contained in .sol files located in 
    solutions/.

3. Project Assumptions

    This project is an implementation of Paxos for state machine replication. 
    In the context of this project, this is realized as a simulation of a simple
    chat room application. 

    The commands available for execution by the Master program are reflected in 
    the assignment API and will not be repeated here. However, there are some 
    implementation details worth noting:

        • sendMessage—— Messages are stored in a FIFO queue (as sanctioned in 
        Piazza post @112). Asynchronicity is simulated by creating a delay 
        matrix upon initializing the run. The delay matrix stores pairwise 
        delays between all clients and servers in a upper triangular matrix; 
        each is delay is randomly generated in the range of 0–500ms.
    
        • allClear—— Our implementation of allClear depends on sleeping the 
        Master thread for the length of time equal to the Heartbeat timeout or 
        500ms—whichever is greater.

        • timeBombLeader—— The current leader is allowed to send the specified 
        number of Phase 1a or Phase 2a messages before crashing (cf., Piazza 
        @96). Any other messages including heartbeats are not impacted by this 
        limit. Additionally, messages sent within the same server (including to 
        other role-threads) are not counted. If for some reason the server 
        crashes BEFORE the timeBomb and is restarted, the timeBomb is nullified.

4. Project Implementation

    The classes Master and Paxos provide the high level framework for the chat 
    room application.
    
        • Master provides the API to interact with the system as specified in 
        the project handout.
        
        • An instance of Paxos is created through the Master class. It provides 
        the interface between the Master controller class and each of the 
        individual server and client nodes as well as the creation and 
        maintenance of inter-node socket communication through a NetController/
        Config configuration instance.    

    Nodes are defined by the "start x y" command issued to the Master 
    controller, in the quantity of (x + y), with x Servers and y Clients. 
    Clients and Servers are both subclasses of the Node class, which contains 
    common state and functionality across both Servers and Clients, such as 
    socket information, process IDs, Message queues, etc.
        └── Node
            ├── Client
            └── Server

    In this implementation of Paxos, Server Nodes serve a variety of roles. 
    Threads are spawned to fill each of these roles on a per-server basis. Each 
    of the "roles" is spawned as a thread instance of the corresponding NodeRole
    subclass as listed below. The NodeRole class serves to encapsulate the basic
    functionality served among all of the various roles, including message 
    send/receive. Note that roles are named as they are in *Paxos Made 
    Moderately Complex*.
        └── NodeRole
            ├── Acceptor
            ├── Commander
            ├── Leader
            ├── Replica
            └── Scout
                     
    Message communication is handled through specific subclasses of the abstract
    Message class (as listed below). Messages are instantiated according to 
    their role in the Paxos algorithm and passed to a buffering queue, which is 
    processed to send messages from client->server, server->server, and server->
    client. Upon receipt, the receiving entity casts the Message received to its
    appropriate type using reflection, and handles it as such. Messages are 
    converted to and from PValues and Strings during the message passing 
    process.
        └── Message
            ├── AdoptedMessage
            ├── DecisionMessage
            ├── HeartBeatMessage
            ├── Phase1aMessage
            ├── Phase1bMessage
            ├── Phase2aMessage
            ├── Phase2bMessage
            ├── PreemptedMessage
            ├── ProposeMessage
            ├── RecoveryReplyMessage
            ├── RecoveryRequestMessage
            ├── RequestMessage
            └── ResponseMessage
         
    In addition to the message types as described in *Paxos Made Moderately 
    Complex* (Adopted, Decision, p1a, p1b, p2a, p2b, Preempted, Propose, 
    Request, and Response), the following message types specific to our 
    implementation are detailed below:
    
        • HeartBeatMessage—— This is a very simple message that serves the 
        purpose of determining if the current leader has crashed. A 
        HeartBeatMessage is sent by the current leader every 
        Constant.HEARTBEATMESSAGEGAP milliseconds (defaults to 100). Every 
        Server has a HeartBeatMessageHandler that monitors for these heartbeats.
        When Constant.TIMEOUTFORHEARTBEAT milliseconds (defaults to 500) passes
        for some Server's HeartBeatMessageHandler without receiving a heartbeat,
        a leader election is triggered, and a new Leader will begin sending 
        heartbeats. 
        
        • RecoveryRequestMessage—— This special message is sent by a Server when
        a recovery is triggered. Its purpose is simply to signal its attempt at
        recovery to all other potentially live Servers, in order to obtain the
        current state of the system.
        
        • RecoveryReplyMessage—— This special message is sent only in reply to
        the receipt of a RecoveryRequestMessage. Any server receiving a recovery
        request sends its current slot number, leader ID, and decision list to
        the recovering server. The recovering server acts upon receiving the 
        first response from a live Server. A new Replica is instantiated with
        this information. As it is a new Replica, its proposal list is empty.
        
             
Appendix A. Java Package Hierarchy

Our Java implementation of Paxos is organized across the following package 
structure. 

Notes:
    • com.cs380d.framework contains a slightly modified version of the Java 
    socket communication code provided with Project 1.
    • Verbose DEBUG mode may be set with the Constant.DEBUG value.
